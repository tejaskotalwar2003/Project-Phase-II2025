🟢 Level 1 – Real-Life Patterns Using Fibonacci

🌱 **Nature and Daily Life**:  
Fibonacci numbers often appear in real-life scenarios like:
- Flower petals
- Pinecones
- Spiral shells

📊 **Simple Use-Cases**:
- A game where points increase in Fibonacci steps
- A robot that moves in a Fibonacci pattern
- A savings plan where each month follows Fibonacci growth

💡 **Why is it useful?**  
These problems make the abstract sequence more concrete and show how it scales step-by-step.

🎯 This level introduces learners to **practical uses** of Fibonacci in fun, relatable contexts.

🟡 Level 2 – Applying Fibonacci in Systems and Models

🧠 **Modeling Growth and Intervals**:
Fibonacci can model:
- Population growth
- Light blinking sequences
- Animation frame timing
- Score progression in games

📘 **Use in Planning**:
- Project managers often use Fibonacci for estimating task sizes.
- Apps may schedule events or savings in increasing intervals.

💡 **What makes it special?**  
The gradual but non-linear growth models **natural scaling** without sudden spikes.

🎯 This level connects Fibonacci to **moderate real-world systems** like apps, projects, and simulations.
