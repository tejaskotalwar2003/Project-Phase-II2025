A hashable object has a hash value that never changes during its lifetime (`__hash__` method) and can be compared to other objects (`__eq__` method). Immutable types (like numbers, strings, tuples) are hashable, whereas mutable types (like lists, sets, dictionaries) are not.\n"

Subsequent lookups for the 'same' (but now modified) key would generate a different hash, causing the dictionary to fail to find the original cached value. This would lead to redundant computations or, worse, incorrect results if the modified key somehow matched a different entry.\n"

        "2.  **Potential for Shorter Max Depth (Indirectly):** While memoization doesn't directly control the *maximum* recursion depth, by pruning redundant branches, it can sometimes lead to a shallower call stack if the 'hot' paths that lead to deepest recursion are among those that are efficiently memoized early. However, for problems like simple Fibonacci, where the recursive calls are `n-1` and `n-2`, the maximum stack depth is still proportional to `N`, even with memoization, as `fib(N)` still needs to compute `fib(N-1)` (which needs `fib(N-2)`, etc.) down to the base case.\n"

            "    * **Time Savings:** Memoization still provides significant time savings by ensuring each unique subproblem is computed once. For example, `fib(N)`'s exponential time becomes linear because `fib(N-1)` and `fib(N-2)` are computed only once, and their sub-dependencies are also memoized.\n"
            "    * **Call Stack Depth:** Memoization generally does *not* reduce the *maximum recursion depth*. If a function like `fib(N)` needs to call `fib(N-1)`, then `fib(N-2)`, and so on, down to `fib(0)` to get the base case, the call stack will still grow to `N` frames. In languages without tail-call optimization (like Python), this can lead to `RecursionError` for very large `N`, regardless of memoization's time-saving ability.\n"
            "2.  **Shallow Recursion (e.g., functions with broad branching factor but quickly hit base cases or cached results):**\n"
            "    * **Time Savings:** Memoization can still provide benefits if the shallow branches lead to many overlapping subproblems. The overall number of calls is reduced.\n"

            "    * **Overhead:** For very shallow recursion with minimal overlapping subproblems, the constant overhead of cache lookups and storage might slightly outweigh the benefits, but this is less common for problems where memoization is usually applied.\n"
            "In summary, memoization always aims to reduce redundant computations. Its interaction with call stack depth is a separate concern related to the language's recursion handling.

This combination can significantly speed up the search by avoiding redundant computation and re-evaluating heuristic values.\n\n"

            "2.  **Memoization Application:** A **transposition table** (which is a form of memoization cache) is commonly used. The key for this table is a unique representation of the game state (e.g., a Zobrist hash of the board). The value stored is the result of the Minimax evaluation for that state (e.g., the optimal score and possibly the best move found from that state, along with the depth of the search).\n"
